Helium, leveraging blockchain technology, employs on-chain
[accounts](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/accounts) for safeguarding Hotspots
and Tokens. An account represents a pair of cryptographic keys â€” a public key and a private key,
embodying
[public key cryptography](https://www.blockchain-council.org/blockchain/how-does-blockchain-use-public-key-cryptography),
a cornerstone of blockchain security. This method marks a shift from traditional username-password
authentication to a more secure, key-based mechanism in the web3 realm.

## Crypto Wallets Explained

A crypto wallet is essentially the keeper of your public and private keys, enabling you to send,
receive, and manage cryptocurrency assets. Wallets can take various forms, from digital files on
your computer, paper printouts, to specialized hardware devices. Moreover, a variety of software
applications provide user-friendly interfaces for wallet management.

While the [Helium Wallet App](/wallets/helium-wallet-app), developed by the Helium Foundation,
caters specifically to Helium Network users, Helium's integration into the Solana ecosystem means
it's accessible via any wallet supporting Solana.

## Deciphering Public and Private Keys

Understanding the distinction between public and private keys is critical for anyone participating
in the web3 space.

### Public Key

Your public key acts as your identity on the blockchain, allowing others to view your token balances
and Hotspots. It's akin to an account number that you can safely share with others. Importantly,
it's mathematically infeasible to derive the private key from the public key, ensuring security.

In the Solana ecosystem, public keys are alphanumeric strings, e.g.,
`dcuc8Amr83Wz27ZkQ2K9NS6r8zRpf1J6cvArEBDZDmm`. Addresses starting with `11`, `13`, or `14` denote
legacy Helium blockchain addresses. Use the [conversion tool](#legacy-l1-conversion) for accurate
address translation.

### Private Key

The private key is your account's most guarded secret, providing complete access to its assets. Loss
of the private key equates to the irreversible loss of the account. Conversely, a lost public key
can be retrieved using the private key and the derivation path specific to Helium Wallet App
accounts.

Private keys commonly manifest as [12-word or 24-word seed phrases](/wallets/wallet-seed-phrase) or
as encrypted files (e.g., `keyfile.bin`). They must be kept secure and confidential.

:::warning **Key Security Reminder**

Never disclose your seed phrases or private keys. Helium never requests these details for support or
promotions. Exercise caution and skepticism towards any such requests.

## Navigating Wallet Migration

Post-migration to Solana on April 18, 2023, Helium wallet users may need to update their access
methods. Refer to the [Wallet User Migration Guide](/solana/migration/wallet-user) for step-by-step
instructions.

For transitioning from the Helium Wallet App to other Solana-compatible wallets, consult
[Third-Party Wallets](/wallets/third-party-wallets) for a comprehensive guide.

### Legacy Helium Addresses Conversion Tool {#legacy-l1-conversion}

Use the tool below to translate between legacy Helium blockchain addresses and current
Solana-compatible addresses. Legacy addresses should not be used for transactions post-migration.
