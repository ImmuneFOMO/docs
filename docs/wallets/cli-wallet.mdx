# Command Line Interface Wallet

The Helium CLI Wallet offers a robust interface for advanced users to interact with the Helium
blockchain, manage tokens, participate in consensus groups, and perform secure transactions directly
from the command line.

## Installing the Helium CLI Wallet

### Running From a Release

To get started quickly, download the latest release of the Helium CLI Wallet from the
[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/helium/helium-wallet-rs/releases). Choose the release that
matches your operating system, unpack the archive, and place the `helium-wallet` binary in a
directory included in your system's `$PATH`.

### Building From Source

For those who prefer to build from source or contribute to the wallet development, the CLI wallet's
source code is available on GitHub. It's written in Rust, offering high performance and safety.
Follow the [build instructions](https://github.com/helium/helium-wallet-rs#building-from-source) in
the repository to compile the wallet on your system.

## Getting Started with the CLI Wallet

After installation, you can explore the wallet's functionalities using the `--help` flag. This flag
provides an up-to-date list of commands and options. For example:

```sh
helium-wallet --help
```

Will display general usage information and a list of available commands.

### Key Commands

- **Creating a Wallet**: To create a new wallet, use:

  ```sh
  helium-wallet create basic
  ```

  This command generates a new wallet file (`wallet.key`) in the current directory and prompts you
  to set a password.

- **Viewing Wallet Information**: For basic wallet details like the public address, use:

  ```bash
  helium-wallet info
  ```

  Add `--qr` to generate a QR code of your wallet's public address, convenient for receiving tokens.

- **Checking Balance**: To check your wallet's balance, run:
  ```sh
  helium-wallet balance
  ```
  This command shows your HNT, Data Credits, and Security Tokens balance.

### Advanced Features

#### Importing a Seed Phrase

If you have an existing wallet from the Helium mobile app or another Helium wallet, you can import
it using the seed phrase with the `--seed` flag:

```sh
helium-wallet create basic --seed
```

You'll be prompted to enter your seed phrase securely.

#### Multi-Signature Wallets

For enhanced security, the CLI wallet supports multi-signature setups. Create a multi-signature
wallet with:

```sh
helium-wallet create multisig --threshold <REQUIRED_SIGS> --signers <PUBLIC_KEY1>,<PUBLIC_KEY2>,...
```

### Best Practices for Security

- **Backup Your Seed Phrase**: Securely store your wallet's seed phrase in multiple locations.
- **Use Strong Passwords**: Encrypt your wallet file with a strong, unique password.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep your CLI wallet updated to the latest version to benefit from security
  and feature enhancements.
