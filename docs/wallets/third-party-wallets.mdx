With Helium's integration into the Solana blockchain, users have the flexibility to manage their
accounts using any Solana-compatible wallet. This guide explores how to utilize third-party wallets
with your Helium account, highlighting the unique features available through the Helium Wallet App
and Maker apps.

## Capabilities and Limitations

While third-party Solana wallets offer a broad range of functionalities, it's important to note that
specific actions related to Hotspot management are exclusive to the Helium Wallet App and certain
Maker apps. These include:

- Claiming Hotspot rewards
- Asserting or updating Hotspot locations
- Configuring antenna settings
- Onboarding new Hotspots

## Exploring Solana Ecosystem Wallets

The Solana ecosystem boasts a diverse selection of wallets, ranging from browser and mobile
app-based solutions to more advanced Command Line Interface (CLI) options for developers or users
seeking granular control. Explore the array of wallets and find the perfect fit for your needs on
the [Solana Ecosystem](https://solana.com/ecosystem/explore?categories=wallet) page.

- For browser and mobile wallets: Check out popular options like [Phantom](https://phantom.app/),
  [Solflare](https://solflare.com/), and [Sollet](https://www.sollet.io/).
- For CLI enthusiasts: Dive into the [Solana CLI](https://docs.solanalabs.com/cli/) and
  [Helium CLI](/wallets/cli-wallet) for a hands-on approach to wallet management.

## Importing Helium Accounts into Solana Wallets

To transfer your Helium account into another Solana-compatible wallet, you'll need the 'Private Key'
of your account. It's crucial to understand that importing using the 12 or 24-word seed phrase may
not display your tokens in the new wallet due to different derivation paths.

### Retrieve Your Account's Private Key

Access the "Reveal Private Key" option within the Helium Wallet App's settings to obtain your
private key.

setting is located within the Helium Wallet App._

Upon revealing your private key, you'll have the option to copy it for use in your chosen Solana
wallet.

### Steps to Import into a Solana Wallet

Using [Phantom](https://phantom.app/) as an example, begin by creating a basic Solana wallet
account. Then, navigate to the 'Manage Accounts' menu to add a new account via the "Import Private
Key" option.
