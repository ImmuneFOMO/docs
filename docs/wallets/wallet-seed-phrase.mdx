# Helium Wallet Seed Phrase

Creating a Helium account generates a 24-word seed phrase, a critical security feature. This
mnemonic phrase, derived from a
[predefined list](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt) of 2048 words,
is the backbone of your account's security, enabling the recovery of the private key if needed.
**The utmost care should be taken to never share this seed phrase.**

## Seed Phrase Security

:::caution **Lose the seed phrase, lose it all.**

Without the seed phrase, there is no way to access your account, the tokens, NFTs it contains, or
any associated Hotspots and their rewards. The seed phrase is irreplaceable and unrecoverable if
lost.

:::

:::note **Key Security Tips:**

1. **Immediately secure your seed phrase**: Write it down and store it in a safe location.
2. **Guard your seed phrase**: Only share with trusted parties. Anyone with access can control your
   assets completely.
3. **Be cautious**: Avoid entering your seed phrase on questionable apps or websites. Trust is
   paramount.

**Securing Your Seed Phrase:**

- **Physical Backup**: Document the seed phrase in its precise sequence. For enhanced security,
  consider using [titanium plates](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=titanium+seed+phrase+plate) for
  durability against physical damage.
- **Digital Storage Warning**: Storing seed phrases on cloud services (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox)
  poses a significant risk. Compromised accounts can lead directly to stolen seed phrases.

**No Recovery Options**: If a seed phrase is lost, forgotten, or misplaced, it cannot be recovered.
Disregard any claims offering recovery services.

**Correct Seed Phrase Entry**:

1. Ensure the **correct order** and **accurate spelling**. Refer to the
   [official list](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt) for guidance.
2. Beware of **similar-sounding words** (e.g., 'car' vs 'can'). Refer to
   [Commonly Misspelled Recovery Seed Words](https://trezor.io/support/a/commonly-misspelled-recovery-seed-words)
   for common errors.

## 12 vs 24-Word Seed Phrases

Helium accounts use either 12 or 24-word seed phrases, with older accounts typically using 12 words
and newer accounts created through the [Helium Wallet App](/wallets/helium-wallet-app) utilizing 24
words. Both lengths are supported by the Helium Wallet app.

A 12-word phrase offers robust security with 3.4 × 10<sup>38</sup> possible combinations, while a
24-word phrase increases security further to about 1.16 × 10<sup>77</sup> possible combinations,
offering optimal protection against brute-force attacks.

| Phrase Length | Possible Combinations  |
| :------------ | :--------------------- |
| 12 Words      | 3.4 × 10<sup>38</sup>  |
| 24 Words      | 1.16 × 10<sup>77</sup> |

Understanding and safeguarding your seed phrase is paramount for maintaining access to your Helium
account and its assets. Adopting best practices for seed phrase security ensures your account's
integrity and the safety of your digital assets.
